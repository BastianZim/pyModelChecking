   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pyModelChecking's documentation!
===========================================

pyModelChecking is a simple Python model checking package. Currently, it is
able to represent :ref:`Kripke structures<Kripke>`, :ref:`CTL<CTL>`,
:ref:`LTL<LTL>`, and :ref:`CTL*<CTLS>` formulas and it provides
`model checking`_ methods for LTL, CTL, and CTL*.
In future, it will hopefully support symbolic model checking.
